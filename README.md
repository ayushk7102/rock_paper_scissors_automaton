# Visualising cellular automata
Cellular automata are discrete computational models that are represented by a grid with cells.
They are visualized by evolving that grid according to certain rules, that is typically a state function of the existing cells.


The rock-paper-scissors model uses a state function similar to the game of rock-paper-scissors, where cells change in a cyclic way depending on the state of their neighbourhood.
